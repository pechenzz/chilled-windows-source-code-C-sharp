# Chilled Windows source code in C#
Chiled Windows source code in C#.
What can i say, except, its decompiled using JetBraint dotPeek!
And its C#. _Might_ soon convert to C++.

Also, this is the path, where GAMELASTER kept the project file, i dunno for what purposes it is, but oke:
C:\Users\gamel\documents\visual studio 2015\Projects\ChilledWindowsWPF\ChilledWindows\obj\Release\ChilledWindows.pdb
_(It might mean, that you need to open pdb file for project...)_
